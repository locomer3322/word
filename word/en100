Nice to meet you.
Shall we dance?
Shall I begin now?
Feel free to try it.
Why don't you take a rest?
I'm not going to take it anymore.
You deserv to take a day off.
You will have to buy a car.
You don't have to lie.
You didn't have to say that.
Do you want me to dance?
I would like to go home.
Would you like say something?
What would you like to say?
I don't want you to break my heart.
I told you not to play the piano at night.
I used to have a good memory.
I used to be able to run fast.
You will be able to sleep well.
